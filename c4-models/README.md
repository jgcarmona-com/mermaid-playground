# C4 Models with Mermaid

This folder contains examples of C4 Models using Mermaid. C4 Models are ideal for representing software architecture at different levels of abstraction.

## Content
- `context-diagram.md`: Context diagrams.
- `container-diagram.md`: Container diagrams.
- `component-diagram.md`: Component diagrams.
- `code-diagram.md`: Code-level diagrams.

## Getting Started with C4 Models
If you are new to C4 Models or want to learn more about how to create them using Mermaid, check out the official [Mermaid C4 Model Documentation](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/c4.html).

The C4 Model is structured into four different levels:
1. **Context**: Shows the interactions of the system with its environment.
2. **Container**: Represents the different containers or applications within the system.
3. **Component**: Illustrates the main components inside each container.
4. **Code**: Provides a deeper level of detail for each component's implementation.

We recommend starting with the context diagram to get a high-level view of your system, then drilling down into container and component diagrams as needed.
