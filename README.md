# Mermaid Playground 

This repository contains various examples and guides on how to create and represent different types of UML and C4 diagrams using Mermaid. The purpose is to help visualize software architecture and design through simple and effective diagrams.

## Content

### UML Diagrams
- **Class Diagrams:** Understand the structure of your system, including classes, attributes, methods, and relationships.
- **Sequence Diagrams:** Visualize the interactions between objects in a sequential manner.
- **Activity Diagrams:** Model workflows and business processes, showing the flow of control.
- **Component Diagrams:** Represent the internal structure of a system, including components and their relationships.
- **Use Case Diagrams:** Identify the functionality provided by a system and the different users that interact with it.

Each subfolder under the `uml` directory contains:
- An `md` file with specific examples for each diagram type.
- Detailed explanations and usage examples in Mermaid syntax.

### C4 Models
- **Context Diagram:** Show the high-level context of the system and its interactions with external entities.
- **Container Diagram:** Represent the containers (applications, databases, etc.) that make up the system.
- **Component Diagram:** Provide details on the internal components of each container.
- **Code Diagram:** Visualize the code structure and interactions within a component or module.

The `c4-models` folder contains:
- An `md` file for each level of the C4 model with comprehensive examples and explanations.
- Overview image (`c4-overview.png`) to provide a visual summary of the C4 approach.

## How to Use This Repository
1. Navigate to the desired folder (`uml` or `c4-models`) based on the type of diagram you want to learn.
2. Open the corresponding markdown (`md`) file to see code snippets and diagram representations using Mermaid.
3. Modify and run the code in your own environment or use tools like [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/) to visualize the diagrams.

For a complete guide on Mermaid syntax and diagram types, check the official [Mermaid Documentation](https://mermaid-js.github.io/).
